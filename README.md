### Description

<p><font face="Arial">Yes, it's a newer graph plotter.<b> <font size="4">It's

much more easier to use than that in XP Power Toys. </font></b><font size="3">You

can just type in the equation(both implicit or explicit) in X,Y form in the text

box, and click "Plot Graph". You can also see the graph f'(x), f''(x),

f'''(x) of an explicit function. See it yourself.</font></font></p>

 Again, this is an updated version of my previous version of graph plotter. Now it can plot graph of dy/dx, d2y/dx2, d3y/dx3. With the combination of my previous equation solver by bisection method(that can solve almost all equations), the new product, "Mathematics 2002" is a very nice mathematics tools that help you to solve most algebra and calculus problems. See it yourself.</font><br>
